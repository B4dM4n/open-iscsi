* get current tests running
  * this will mean replacing disktest with something
    (like fio?)

* convert to PyTest insteal of shell

* have tests create their own target using targetcli and
  a file?

* have tests do discovery themselves, instead of requiring
  that to be done already

* Augment tests
  * framework for adding new tests and test types,e.g.:
    - multipathing
    - using interface files or not
    - discovery, with and without authentication
    - session creation, w/ & w/o auth
    - etc

* Gather actual regression data!
  - Since we are testing all of these combinations, why not
    keep historical data to see if there are any negative
    trends (i.e. regressions)?
