* get current tests running
  * this will mean replacing disktest with something
    (like fio?)

* ensure user is root?

* have tests create their own target using targetcli and
  a file?

* have tests do discovery themselves, instead of requiring
  that to be done already. Either way, we may still need
  to know the IQN of our target and the host where it lives.

* Augment tests
  * framework for adding new tests and test types,e.g.:
    - multipathing
    - using interface files or not
    - discovery, with and without authentication
    - session creation, w/ & w/o auth
    - etc

* Gather actual regression data!
  - Since we are testing all of these combinations, why not
    keep historical data to see if there are any negative
    trends (i.e. regressions)? Need to understand fio and bonnie++
    output better to find a way to gather one or two datapoints
    (max) per test, out of all the info dumped by these
    programs.

* Add in test cases for Discovery and/or Connection validation,
  which would require either a separate target set up for that,
  or control of our own target

* Only allow /dev/disk/by-* paths, as /dev/sd? paths are
  inherently problematic, since they can change names.

* Add back in the "big warning" from regression.sh?

* Add info to the README about how to run the python tests

* Leave the regression test around, for now? It doesn't run,
  so maybe it should just be removed?
